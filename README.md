# MetaOnRails

Welcome! This is a website (well, kind of a blog, more specifically) built using RubyOnRails where I'll talk about my journey learning RubyOnRails!<br>
I don't have much more to say... Hope you enjoy it.

Feel free to clone the repository to make your own Rails blog or just create a new one using `rails new [blog_name_goes_here]`.<br>
Stay safe, stay curious.

Happy coding!
